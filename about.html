        <p>It follows the story of Sophia, a woman in a high position at a relatively young age, coming back to her first alma mater after a long time away from her hometown. A ghost from the past resurfaces that starts hitting on her, and from there spirals down into a very intimate and personal journey of facing her true self.</p>
        <p>The story in general is about older women facing troubles, just when they thought they figured it all out.</p>
        <p>This comic updates <strong>monthly</strong> with a whole chapter.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarejusta</strong> is an artist with storytelling and world-building close to her heart. With a multidisciplinary approach, she is professionally active through freelance in visdev, concept and comics-oriented work.  In her free time, she enjoys cooking, gaming, TTRPGs (you’ll take Pathfinder from her cold, dead hands) and painting Warhammer figurines.</p> 
            <p>Previous published comic works were all very short and featured in <strong>Pilot Comic Anthology</strong>, a local publication that lasted for 4 years and <strong>Stejjer Impenġijja</strong>. A myriad of unpublished comic work that never saw the light of day, sitting somewhere in her studio.</p>
